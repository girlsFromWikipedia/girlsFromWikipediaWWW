    <h1 class="display-5 fw-normal mb-4 text-center">Blog</h1> 
    <h5 class="fw-bold">There has been a lot of talks lately about the rather unusual but catchy domain name girlsFromWikipedia.com. Is it correctly associated with a pornographic website?</h5> 
    <p>As the creators of the site we actually often get such feedback. First of all, it is important to emphasize that the girlsFromWikipedia.com project did not originate from an attempt to find a niche in the porn industry, nor from a need to develop our team in this particular area of business.</p> 
    <h5 class="fw-bold">Why then is this the first thing that comes to mind when we see the name of your website?</h5> 
    <p>This is how social media works and how the Internet influences our subconscious. We see a particular name, we make an association and we assign to it a meaning that is not there.</p> 
    <h5 class="fw-bold">Are there any advantages to this?</h5> 
    <p>Of course! The stronger and more extreme the associations, the more recipients, and thus more interest in the website. Internet users can search for all sorts of content and this is how they end up at girlsFromWikipedia.com.</p> 
    <h5 class="fw-bold">So, getting to the heart of the question - how did the creation of girlsFromWikipedia.com come about?</h5> 
    <p>As is usually the case with unconventional and inspiring projects. Nowadays, the Internet is a huge source of knowledge, both for younger and older generations.</p> 
    <p>Sometimes the amount of knowledge can overwhelm us and make us lose our way instead of finding answers to our questions. The girlsFromWikipedia website was created in order to organize certain knowledge.</p> 
    <p>The basis for the creation of the website was the desire to bring up a topic that everyone talks about, but not much is known about it. You could say that it was a need to create a small social revolution.</p> 
    <h5 class="fw-bold">Who is behind girlsFromWikipedia.com?</h5> 
    <p>A team of creative and inspiring people who have a concrete plan and are gradually implementing it.</p> 
    <h5 class="fw-bold">What kind of "knowledge" can we find on the website?</h5> 
    <p>As the name suggests, the girlsFromWikipedia site focuses on the female body. It is worth noting that this "body" is understood in a broad context. Both physical and psychosocial.</p> 
    <h5 class="fw-bold">So what is the character of the site?</h5> 
    <p>The most correct answer would be: educational and social.</p> 
    <h5 class="fw-bold">In what sense is it educational?</h5> 
    <p>Our website was created to educate the younger generations about bodily diversity.</p> 
    <p>Each of us is different, both mentally and physically. As you can see, social media has been very effective at undermining the self-esteem of women of all ages by imposing unrealistic standards of appearance.</p> 
    <p>The website girlsFromWikipedia.com aims to educate, both women and men, about the diversity of the human body.</p> 
    <h5 class="fw-bold">And in what sense is the site social?</h5> 
    <p>The social nature of the site is closely related to education. Education is not only about school or book knowledge. It is also the formation of social attitudes.</p> 
    <p>By using the site, viewers can broaden their social horizons in the future, including through greater resistance to unrealistic images of the female body created by the world of social media and through increased empathy and understanding of each other.</p> 
    <h5 class="fw-bold">Are there nude photos on the girlsFromWikipedia website?</h5> 
    <p>Yes, but they are unique. The photos are an integral part of our site. They are visually intriguing and attract viewers.</p> 
    <h5 class="fw-bold">Why should nude photos from the site be different from other nude photos?</h5> 
    <p>Our photos are educational, social, perhaps a bit experimental in scientific terms. They allow us to find out how a realistic image of the female body, not altered by filters and photoshop, is perceived.</p> 
    <p>A kind of feedback constitutes a kind of scientific research.</p> 
    <h5 class="fw-bold">Who is girlsFromWikipedia.com for?</h5> 
    <p>Our website is intended for a wide audience. This includes everyone who is interested in breaking the stereotypes of the appearance of the female body and who wants to educate themselves in this regard.</p> 
    <h5 class="fw-bold">What will we find on the site? What kind of content can we expect?</h5> 
    <p>We are constantly trying to develop our site and edit it according to the expectations of our audience. GrilsFromWikipedia.com is a site that encourages body-positivity and in this respect, we will continually develop it. As such, the site features the aforementioned beautiful, realistic photos of women, but also their life stories.</p> 
    <h5 class="fw-bold">What are the stories of the women on girlsFromWikipedia.com?</h5> 
    <p>Every woman has a story to tell. We encourage our users to share them with the audience of the site. These are stories about changing your perspective on yourself, your body.</p> 
    <p>Sometimes such changes come with age and life experience, sometimes they are achieved by trial and error. On the other hand, there are many young women on our website. They don't have a lot of life experience, but they have a lot of clouts and willingness to share it with other site users.</p> 
    <h5 class="fw-bold">What are the strengths of GrilsFromWikipedia.com?</h5> 
    <p>First and foremost, the ability to grow. Our site is very popular and the audience is growing every day. This gives us an opportunity to add new elements to the website as it is the users who give the direction of its development.</p> 
    <h5 class="fw-bold">What elements are we talking about?</h5> 
    <p>As already mentioned sharing unusual photos, life stories, expanding the community forum, building relationships, sharing interesting articles in the field of body positivity.</p> 
    <h5 class="fw-bold">Does webopage girlsFromwipedia.com have a viable future?</h5> 
    <p>Of course it does. We see it every day. As long as we get more users, we will stay afloat, for that matter, we have no doubt about it. The statistics speak for themselves.</p> 
    <h5 class="fw-bold">And the weakest parts of girlsFromWikipedia.com?</h5> 
    <p>This is a very good question. In the beginning, we thought that because of the association with the porn industry the audience would not be quite what we expected. But it turns out that we were wrong. Wrong associations work to our advantage.</p> 
    <p>Pageviews are increasing every day, and 90% of users who visited our site come back again.</p> 
    <h5 class="fw-bold">What does this mean?</h5> 
    <p>It means that the content of the site is so attractive that even a user looking for completely different content (and not finding it here) decides to come back.</p> 
    <p>Usually, we enter the world of the Internet with a specific intention. If a person came here looking for, let's say, adult websites, and by force of association found us and did not find the expected content, they should be disappointed. If they were disappointed, they certainly wouldn't come back the next day. Our users do come back, as the statistics show. This means that something about girlsFromWikipedia attracted them.</p> 
    <h5 class="fw-bold">What can attract them to your website?</h5> 
    <p>Unconventionality, innovative approach, and truth. This truth may not be as 'beautiful' as in the filter-changing world created by social media, but remember that beauty is a relative concept. GrilsFromWikipedia.com shows the beauty that is unobvious, uncommon. This new concept of beauty makes it so intriguing that users decide to keep coming back.</p> 
    <h5 class="fw-bold">Are there any concerns about girlsFromWikipedia?</h5> 
    <p>We do not have any concerns about the functioning of our site. We are fully confident that we are creating such interesting content that there is only a lot of inspiring work ahead of us, but no worries.</p> 
    <h5 class="fw-bold">Where do you see the success of girlsFromWikipedia?</h5> 
    <p>The first thing is the fantastic domain name. Most users are familiar with Wikipedia. The domain is extremely powerful because it is memorable and arouses interest, as we mentioned earlier. Since everyone is familiar with Wikipedia, you may be wondering what girlsFromWikipedia.com is all about. </p> 
    <p>Getting people interested in the site, creating intrigue, is the first success of the site.</p> 
    <h5 class="fw-bold">What goes behind the interest in the page?</h5> 
    <p>Obviously, the number of views grows every day. People discovering our site share it with their friends, acquaintances, and family. Dissemination of our site among users and on social networks is a huge driving force of our development.</p>
